# CRC_Risk_BN

The following repository contains the code used in "Colorectal cancer risk mapping through Bayesian networks"

The functions _BayesianEstimator.py_ and _BayesianNetwork.py_ are modified versions of the original functions _pgmpy_ which would need to be replaced in this library for the main code to run properly
